## What is covered

All material covered in lecture, homeworks and labs

## Links to past exams


Here are some exams from past offerings of CS8 that you can look at to get an idea of the style of exam questions I typically write.

Please note that this quarter we may have covered MORE MATERIAL or LESS MATERAL than the point at which midterm 1 was given in previous quarters.  Also, these courses all used a different textbook, and there were different homeworks and different labs.   So your exam may cover much more or much less material.  Use these as guides for style of exam rather than precise content.
